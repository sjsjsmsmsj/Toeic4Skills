11. Do you think that people should not use
                             social networking sites?

I think that people should not use social networking sites.

First, it's harmful(Có hại). This is because there is a lot of 
toxic information on social networking sites.

Secong, it's very easy to get addicted to(dễ dàng bị nghiện)
these sites. Therefore, people might neglect other important things.

Let me tell you my story. When i was a child, i was addicted to
facebook. I spent most of my time playing, so i didn't have time for
my studies. As a result, I failed an important exam.

That's why i think so.
