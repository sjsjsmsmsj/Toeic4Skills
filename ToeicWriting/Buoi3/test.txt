Do you prefer to work for a big company or a small company?

When choosing a company to work for, one of the most important
factors that a person needs to consider is its size. Personally,
I prefer to work for a big company and there are several
reasons to support my opinion.

First, it reduces stress. When i work in a big company,
they usually offer high salaries. Many of my life problems are related
to money. if i have sufficient budget, i won't worry as much about
the challenges i face daily. In the past, i  was a student, i didn't 
have much money to purse my interests,
and i had to pay for rent, electricity, water on a regular basis(thường xuyên).

Second, it's easier to learn from people who are better than i am.
When i have some mistakes, i can get some advice from them 
quickly. They are very smart, i strive to follow their behaviour
to improve myself. Additionally, they are very kind in 
their interactions. Last month, while i working at a small company,
i encountered issues but struggled to ask for help because my 
colleagues were often unresponsive.

Third, it helps me save time. I only need to work 8 hours 
a day. I can engage in activies i enjoy and spend time with my family. 
These are things i couldn't do in the past. If i work in
a small company, i would have to work 12 hours. When i went to 
home, everyone would already be sleep. I found that very tiring.

For these reasons, i believe working for a big company is the 
better choice for me.
